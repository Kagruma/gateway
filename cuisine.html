        <h2>Matcha</h2>
        <h3>Pricing:1,000-2,000Yen</h3>

        <p>Matcha in tea ceremony is served in two ways – usucha, or thin tea; and koicha, or thick tea. The former is what tea people think of as “thin,” with the mouthfeel and consistency of a cappuccino. It’s an emulsion of green tea powder and hot water, so one cannot linger too long as it will eventually separate. Koicha is a vivid forest green, almost paste-like in its viscosity. It’s rare to see this style of tea outside of a formal invitation, as it’s not the most accessible way to drink matcha for the layperson – it can be overwhelming and bitter for those unused to drinking matcha.</p>
